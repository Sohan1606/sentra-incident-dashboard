  - Staff see **only incidents assigned to them**.  
  - Quick view of reference, category, priority, status.

Create a `.env` file in `backend`:

```
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
PORT=5000
```

Run backend:

```
npm start
```

Backend will run on `http://localhost:5000`.

### 3. Frontend setup

In another terminal:

```
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

## Future Enhancements

- Real-time notifications / email alerts when incidents are created or resolved. [file:2]  
- More detailed analytics & charts on Admin Dashboard.  
- Richer awareness content (PDFs, videos, external resources).  
- More advanced UI animations and 3D-style visualizations.
